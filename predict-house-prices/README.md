![Project Banner](./images/house.jpg)  
*Predict house prices using machine learning with insightful visualizations of gradient descent and cost function optimization.*

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **machine learning model** to predict house prices based on house size, built using **linear regression with gradient descent**. Developed as part of the *Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification* course by Prof. Andrew Ng (Stanford, 2025), it showcases practical AI skills in Python, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib, delivered via Jupyter Notebook. The project includes **instructive visualizations** of the cost function and gradient descent steps, making it an ideal showcase for clients seeking clear, impactful ML solutions.

Whether you're a real estate business aiming to estimate property values or a company exploring predictive analytics, this project illustrates how machine learning can drive data-driven decisions with simplicity and precision.
